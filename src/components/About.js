                    <p className= "pt-4 fs-2">I am passioned about to solve problems. It's about finding the most elegant way to write a line of code which fits best into a progression, I love the challenge of finding a way and discovering solutions.</p>
                    <p className= "pt-4 fs-2">My name is Christian Fuchs, I live in Austria. Currently I work for Quindoo a IT Company as a Junior Business Consultant. In my spare time I am studying at Treehouse to strengthen my software developer skills. For me, itâ€™s very exciting to create something new. </p>
                    <p className= "pt-4 fs-2">Back then, when I was a 10 year old kid, it was always fascinating how PCs and the software work. But couldn't find it out what's' going on there. In my early 20's when I was doing my Matura (A-Level), with a focus on media informatics, I knew that one day I want to work creatively with my PC. I am convinced that my future lies in this profession. Therefore I spend the most of my freetime to get this done.</p>
                    <p className= "pt-4 fs-2">When I have a day off, I really like hiking and go to the top of the beautiful mountains here. I can enjoy the beautiful nature there and regain some energy. I also like to climb, especially bouldering because you always have to solve a problem there too ;). This all really helps to recharge.</p>
